This is a contact / php mail form script that uses reCAPTCHA to verify that a human is submitting it.

Feel free to help out on it. If you wish to contact the author, he can be reached at danielc [at] tocloud [dot] us.

To use it on your own site:
Drop it into a folder, such as /var/www/vhosts/myvhost.com/htdocs/contact
Modify the "settings" array in the file common.php to match your wanted settings.

** Be sure to remove the sanity line from the settings array. :) **

Thanks to http://beta.phpformatter.com/ for helping me get my code human readable.
